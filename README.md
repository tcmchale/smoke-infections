Analyzing exposure to smoke and risk of infections

We will be analyzing the spatiotemporal risk of exposure to smoke and infections.
We hypothesize that exposure to smoke and incidence of wildfires may increase the risk of fungal infections such as aspergillosis, mucormycosis or cryptococcosis.

We will use COVID 2020 data as an example of how this analysis might be done.
